# Typhoon (IS NOT A FRAMEWORK)

### Description

You can call _Typhoon_ as a bootstrapper and application manager for web application based on [Python Tornado Web Framework](http://www.tornadoweb.org).

### Versions

Latest release branch always at `master` branch.  Development branch always at `dev`.

```
Alpha: 0.4.1
```
Supported Python versions : `2.7.x`.

For current version, _Typhoon_ still on active development, the structure and API still on active
improvement, and i decide to active on unit test.

Supported python versions:

```
Python 2.7.x
```

### Rationale

Tornado is a great python framework for web application or server applications.  The problem come if we want to start to work for a new project, the problem is we just start it from scratch.  _Typhoon_ **is not a framework** on top of Tornado, the purpose of _Typhoon_ is to make our structures between projects more consistent, and give you (and maybe your team) an idea how to start and manage a new project using Tornado.

And for the bonus, i tried to add some utilities that maybe we need it every time we start a new project such as for :


- Environment variables
- Session management
- Unit & integration tests
- Use Motor as main database driver for Mongo
- CLI Tools: routes, builder
- Dockerized

### Logic

The structure of _Typhoon_ is web application that consists of many apps.  Each app should `contain` two important informations :

- Application name
- Application routes

We register each app via `Registry` class to parse application name and their routes.  These routes will be used in `main.py` for `tornado.web.Application`.
